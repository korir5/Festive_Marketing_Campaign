# Business Problem
Festive seasons represent a peak shopping period, and retailers must leverage effective marketing campaigns to capitalize on increased consumer spending. The Retail Super Store recognizes the opportunity to attract customers looking to buy shopping for celebrations and gatherings during this time. The business problem is to design and execute a highly successful festive marketing campaign to boost sales and strengthen the brand's market position.
# Data
Data sources for this project will include:<br>
